<img src="screenshot.jpg" width="35%" height="35%"/>

## Controls
- D-pad or `2`, `4`, `6`, `8` to move cursor (`4` = `left`, `8` = `up`, `6` = `right`, `2` = `down`)
- `enter`, `space` or `5` to place a tower
- `N` to spawn the next wave
- `P` to pause the game
- `Esc` to quit the game

## Installation
[Ndless](https://github.com/ndless-nspire/Ndless) needs to be installed and activated for the executable to run.<br>
After that, use the [TI-Nspire Computer Link](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-nspire-computer-link) software to transfer the executable.

## Disclaimer
This project started life over half a decade ago, so you'll have to excuse past me's coding skills. <br>
Most of the time since it has either spent on the backburner or being rewritten due to me learning new things, so the project is still pretty bare-bones.

## Concept
Think a simplified Bloons Tower Defense 5, but with more resource management (wood, stone, etc.). And it runs on a calculator.
